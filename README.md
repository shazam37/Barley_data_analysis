# Barley_data_analysis

Different types of crops respond differently to Infrared singal. But there is a range of IR frequency/wavelength characteristic to every crop. Here I have done analysis on barley crop and tested different ML models for finding out the IR range. 

My analysis found out that barley crops are sensitive in the 842-859 nm IR range
